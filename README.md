# COEN352-Assignment-Problems
The problems in this repository are solved directly from Algorithms 4th edition by Robert Sedgewick. 5 theory questions and 5 coding questions were solved in this assignment. The section and the question numbers are all written down as the names of the java files. All of these files were written and compiled on eclipse.
